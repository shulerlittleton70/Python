#Like many languages, Python works in blocks of code.

#One of the design principles of Python, thoughm was that it
#should be uncluttered and easy to read.

#Because of this, Python doesnt use delimiters around blocks of code.

#If you have used other languages, you may have seen them use braces {} or BEGIN and END around code.
#Python doesnt use anything like thatm but instead uses indentation to indicate when a new block starts.
