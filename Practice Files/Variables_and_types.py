#When a prgram is running, everything the program
# needs ends up stored in the computers memory.
#The program code itself will be stored in one area of
# memory, and the data it works on will also be
#Stored somewhere in memory

#A variable is basically just a way to give a meaningful
# name to an area of memory, into which we can place
#certain values
